# Concise Control Flow with `if let` and `let else`
`if let` lets you combine `if` and `let` into a less verbose way to handle values that match one pattern and ignore the rest. For example, if you wanted to do this with a regular match:
```rs
    let config_max = Some(3u8);
    match config_max {
        Some(max) => println!("The maximum is configured to be {max}"),
        _ => (),
    }
```
But this can be done more efficently with `if let`:
```rs
    let config_max = Some(3u8);
    if let Some(max) = config_max {
        println!("The maximum is configured to be {max}");
    }
```
Note that this isn't always an improvement, as you lose the exhaustive checking of `match`.

You can also combine `if let` with `else`, which acts the same as the block of code that would have gone with `_`:
```rs
    let mut count = 0;
    match coin {
        Coin::Quarter(state) => println!("State quarter from {state:?}!"),
        _ => count += 1,
    }
```
VS
```rs
    let mut count = 0;
    if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
        println!("State quarter from {state:?}!");
    } else {
        count += 1;
    }
```
# Staying on the "Happy Path" with `let...else`
Its common to perform a computation when a value is present, and return a default otherwise. You can introduce a method to check the age of a state:
```rs
impl UsState {
    fn existed_in(&self, year: u16) -> bool {
        match self {
            UsState::Alabama => year >= 1819,
            UsState::Alaska => year >= 1959,
            // -- snip --
        }
    }
}
```
And with `if let` to match the type of coin and add a state variable:
```rs
fn describe_state_quarter(coin: Coin) -> Option<String> {
    if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
        if state.existed_in(1900) {
            Some(format!("{state:?} is pretty old, for America!"))
        } else {
            Some(format!("{state:?} is relatively new."))
        }
    } else {
        None
    }
}
```
This works but could potentially be hard to follow, so you can move the code out of the `if let`:
```rs
fn describe_state_quarter(coin: Coin) -> Option<String> {
    let state = if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
        state
    } else {
        return None;
    };

    if state.existed_in(1900) {
        Some(format!("{state:?} is pretty old, for America!"))
    } else {
        Some(format!("{state:?} is relatively new."))
    }
}
```
And another method:
```rs
fn describe_state_quarter(coin: Coin) -> Option<String> {
    let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin else {
        return None;
    };

    if state.existed_in(1900) {
        Some(format!("{state:?} is pretty old, for America!"))
    } else {
        Some(format!("{state:?} is relatively new."))
    }
}
```
