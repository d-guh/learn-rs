# References and Borrowing
Though ownership is cool, when trying to caulcate things like length of a `String`, you dont want to "steal" the varaible when you just need it for a moment.\
Thankfully, you can pass a reference of the `String` variable instead (similar to references in other languages, usees `&`)
```rs
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{s1}' is {len}.");
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```
Note that dereferencing also exists `*`, but not relevant at the moment
```rs
fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize { // s is a reference to a String
    s.len()
} // Here, s goes out of scope. But because s does not have ownership of what
  // it refers to, the String is not dropped.
```
Now, since you don't own a variable passed by reference, you are unable to modify it.
```rs
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    change(&s);
}

fn change(some_string: &String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```
References are immutable, just like regular variables.
## Mutable References
Just like variables, you can also make references mutable `&mut`
```rs
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```
This explicitly states that the function `change` will modify the passed string

There is a restriction though: if you pass a mutable reference, you cannot have any other references.\
WILL NOT COMPILE:
```rs
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &mut s;
    let r2 = &mut s;

    println!("{r1}, {r2}");
```
This prevents data races (similar to race conditions)

You can also combine this concept with scope
```rs
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    {
        let r1 = &mut s;
    } // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.

    let r2 = &mut s;
```

There's also similar issues when combining mutable and immutable references:\
WILL NOT COMPILE:
```rs
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM

    println!("{r1}, {r2}, and {r3}");
```
<!-- This is super interesting, its like a mega-agressive GC but with less overhead! -->
However, if you factor in scope correctly, you can avoid this issue:
```rs
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    println!("{r1} and {r2}");
    // Variables r1 and r2 will not be used after this point.

    let r3 = &mut s; // no problem
    println!("{r3}");
```
## Dangling References
Like other languages, its very easy to create dangling pointers.\
Rust prevents this with a compile-time error:
```rs
fn main() {
    let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
}

fn dangle() -> &String { // dangle returns a reference to a String

    let s = String::from("hello"); // s is a new String

    &s // we return a reference to the String, s
} // Here, s goes out of scope and is dropped, so its memory goes away.
  // Danger!
```
To fix this, we would return the `String` itself instead of a reference. This correctly passes ownership.
