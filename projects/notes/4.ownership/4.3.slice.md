# The Slice Type
Slices allow you to reference sequence of elements in a collection, as a type of reference.

This becomes useful in the following problem:
> write a function that takes a string of words separated by spaces and returns the first word it finds in that string. If the function doesnâ€™t find a space in the string, the whole string must be one word, so the entire string should be returned.

Here's how this would be accomplished without slices:
```rs
fn first_word(s: &String) -> usize {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return i;
        }
    }

    s.len()
}
```
```rs
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello world");

    let word = first_word(&s); // word will get the value 5

    s.clear(); // this empties the String, making it equal to ""

    // word still has the value 5 here, but s no longer has any content that we
    // could meaningfully use with the value 5, so word is now totally invalid!
}
```
Which is definitley not ideal, and gets even worse when checking for a second word:
```rs
fn second_word(s: &String) -> (usize, usize) {
```
So we can use string slices
## String Slices
```rs
    let s = String::from("hello world");

    let hello = &s[0..5];
    let world = &s[6..11];
```
Rather than referencing the entire `String`, `hello` is a reference to a portion of the `String`, in the format `[starting_index..ending_index]` where ending_index is not inclusive.
Internally this is calculated as `ending_index - starting_index`, where `let world = &s[6..11];` would be a slice to the byte at index 6 of `s` with a len of `5`.

You can also omit the 0 if you're starting at the beginning of a string:
```rs
let s = String::from("hello");

let slice = &s[0..2];
let slice = &s[..2];
```
The same for the end of the string:
```rs
let s = String::from("hello");

let len = s.len();

let slice = &s[3..len];
let slice = &s[3..];
```
Or the entire string:
```rs
let s = String::from("hello");

let len = s.len();

let slice = &s[0..len];
let slice = &s[..];
```
Now we can rewrite the original function to return a slice:
```rs
fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &s[..]
}
```
The index is found the same way, but it returns a slice.\
This also makes the second word problem much easier:
```rs
fn second_word(s: &String) -> &str {
```
This also prevents errors later, by ensuring the following code will not compile:
```rs
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello world");

    let word = first_word(&s);

    s.clear(); // error!

    println!("the first word is: {word}");
```
Since this is mixing mutable and immutable references
### String Literals as Slices
String literals themselves are simply stored as slices in the binary:
```rs
let s = "Hello, world!";
```
The type of `s` is `&str`, pointing to the specific point of the binary.
### String Slices as Parameters
We can also improve the signature of `first_word`, which is currently:
```rs
fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {
```
And can be adjusted to:
```rs
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
```
Which supports types of both `&String` and `&str`.

Usage examples:
```rs
fn main() {
    let my_string = String::from("hello world");

    // `first_word` works on slices of `String`s, whether partial or whole.
    let word = first_word(&my_string[0..6]);
    let word = first_word(&my_string[..]);
    // `first_word` also works on references to `String`s, which are equivalent
    // to whole slices of `String`s.
    let word = first_word(&my_string);

    let my_string_literal = "hello world";

    // `first_word` works on slices of string literals, whether partial or
    // whole.
    let word = first_word(&my_string_literal[0..6]);
    let word = first_word(&my_string_literal[..]);

    // Because string literals *are* string slices already,
    // this works too, without the slice syntax!
    let word = first_word(my_string_literal);
}
```
## Other Slices
Slices aren't specific to strings:
```rs
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let slice = &a[1..3];

assert_eq!(slice, &[2, 3]); // true!
```
