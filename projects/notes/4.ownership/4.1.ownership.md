# Ownership
Memory management system, not garbage collected, not manual, ownership based

Understand stack vs heap
## Ownership Rules
- Each value has an owner
- Only one owner at a time
- When owner goes out of scope, the value gets dropped
## Variable Scope
Scope is the range for which an item is valid\
String literal example:
```rs
    {                      // s is not valid here, since it's not yet declared
        let s = "hello";   // s is valid from this point forward

        // do stuff with s
    }                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
```
## The `String` type
The `String` type is a heap-allocated type for unknown-length strings, that are mutable
```rs
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    s.push_str(", world!"); // push_str() appends a literal to a String

    println!("{s}"); // this will print `hello, world!`
```
## Memory and Allocation
Rather than manually allocating or relying on a GC to free memory, memory is automatically dropped when it goes out of scope:
```rs
    {
        let s = String::from("hello"); // s is valid from this point forward

        // do stuff with s
    }                                  // this scope is now over, and s is no
                                       // longer valid
```
This can lead to more complex situations with multiple variables
### Variables and Data Interacting with Move
Simple assignment of integers (stack):
```rs
    let x = 5;
    let y = x;
```
String version (heap):
```rs
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1; // not a full copy, stores reference to heap memory
```
To avoid double-free, the first value is invalidated when it is "copied" to the 2nd one.\
This code will not compile:
```rs
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;

    println!("{s1}, world!");
```
This is referred to as a *move* operation (rather than shallow copy) since the 1st ptr is invalidated.
### Scope and Assignment
A similar operation happens when a completley new value is assigned to an existing variable:
```rs
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    s = String::from("ahoy"); // hello is out of scope and dropped here

    println!("{s}, world!");
```
### Variables and Data Interacting with Clone
If you NEED to do a deep copy of the heap data, you can use `clone`
```rs
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1.clone();

    println!("s1 = {s1}, s2 = {s2}");
```
### Stack-Only Data: Copy
However, this is not the same for stack data, this is becuase for types that are of a known size at compile time, its the same efficency to copy `x` exactly, so clone is not needed.
```rs
    let x = 5;
    let y = x;

    println!("x = {x}, y = {y}");
```
There's an annotation called the `Copy` trait, that specifies this behavior.\
This by default applies to the usual stack types: `u32`, `bool`, `f64`, `char`, tuples that only contain `Copy` data: `(i32, i32)`
## Ownership and Functions
Passing values to functions behaves the same as assignment, and will move or copy as nessecary.
```rs
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x);                  // Because i32 implements the Copy trait,
                                    // x does NOT move into the function,
                                    // so it's okay to use x afterward.

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. However, because s's value was moved,
  // nothing special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{some_string}");
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{some_integer}");
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
```
Trying to use `s` after the call to `take_ownership()` it would throw a compile time error.
## Return Values and Scope
Returning values can also transfer ownership
```rs
fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();        // gives_ownership moves its return
                                       // value into s1

    let s2 = String::from("hello");    // s2 comes into scope

    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2); // s2 is moved into
                                       // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                       // moves its return value into s3
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 was moved, so nothing
  // happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -> String {       // gives_ownership will move its
                                       // return value into the function
                                       // that calls it

    let some_string = String::from("yours"); // some_string comes into scope

    some_string                        // some_string is returned and
                                       // moves out to the calling
                                       // function
}

// This function takes a String and returns a String.
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String {
    // a_string comes into
    // scope

    a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}
```
Same pattern as before, assigning a value to another variable moves, when out of scope, data is dropped unless moved.

You can also return multiple values using a tuple:
```rs
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);

    println!("The length of '{s2}' is {len}.");
}

fn calculate_length(s: String) -> (String, usize) {
    let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String

    (s, length)
}
```
