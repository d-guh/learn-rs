# Defining and Instantiating Structs
Looks kinda like c structs tbh\
`struct` keyword followed by name
```rs
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}
```
Create an instance of a struct using usual variable definition:
```rs
fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        active: true,
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
}
```
Access values in a struct via dot notation.\
Mutable example:
```rs
fn main() {
    let mut user1 = User {
        active: true,
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };

    user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@example.com");
}
```
Functions can build/return structs:
```rs
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        active: true,
        username: username,
        email: email,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}
```
## Using the Field Init Shorthand
You can shorthand/avoid repition as follows:
```rs
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        active: true,
        username,
        email,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}
```
## Creating Instances from Other Instances with Struct Update Syntax
The old method:
```rs
fn main() {
    // --snip--

    let user2 = User {
        active: user1.active,
        username: user1.username,
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,
    };
}
```
the `..` specifies that the remaining fields that are not set explicity should have the same values as the given instance
```rs
fn main() {
    // --snip--

    let user2 = User {
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        ..user1
    };
}
```
## Using Tuple Structs Without Named Fields to Create Different Types
You can combine tuples and structs
```rs
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

fn main() {
    let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
    let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
}
```
## Unit-Like Structs Without Any Fields
Its kinda just a tuple lowkey
```rs
struct AlwaysEqual;

fn main() {
    let subject = AlwaysEqual;
}
```
## Ownership of Struct Data
Talked about more in ch10, basically just use `String` type instead of `&str`/string literals.
```rs
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: &str,
    email: &str,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        active: true,
        username: "someusername123",
        email: "someone@example.com",
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
}
```
