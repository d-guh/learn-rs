# Control Flow
Conditional code execution with booleans
## `if` Expressions
Typical `if` stuff
```rs
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}
```
## Multiple Conditions with `else if`
Oh boy can't wait to chain 20 of these
```rs
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}
```
## Using `if` in a `let` statement
YOO this is big
```rs
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

    println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}
```
## Repetition with Loops
`loop`, `while`, `for` loops
### Repeating with `loop`
```rs
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("again!"); // basically just a while true lmao
    }
}
```
### Returning Values from Loops
Wrap loop in expression, value to return after break
```rs
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!("The result is {result}");
}
```
### Loop Labels
Specifies which loop to break, this is neat that you can break scope like this
```rs
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    'counting_up: loop {
        println!("count = {count}");
        let mut remaining = 10;

        loop {
            println!("remaining = {remaining}");
            if remaining == 9 {
                break;
            }
            if count == 2 {
                break 'counting_up;
            }
            remaining -= 1;
        }

        count += 1;
    }
    println!("End count = {count}");
}
```
### Conditional Loops with `while`
Standard while loop
```rs
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0 {
        println!("{number}!");

        number -= 1;
    }

    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```
### Looping collection with `for`
Standard for loop\
WHILE EXAMPLE:
```rs
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    let mut index = 0;

    while index < 5 {
        println!("the value is: {}", a[index]);

        index += 1;
    }
}
```
FOR EQUIVALENT:
```rs
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a {
        println!("the value is: {element}");
    }
}
```
Range based for:
```rs
fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{number}!");
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```
